# snake-clone
Microproject started out of boredom

The game's code was written in a day and is not the best example for clean code that conforms to convention :D.
To compile the code you need to download and include the SFML2 library for the approptiate platform.
The game's executable is attached and works on Windows 64, the Lato-Black.ttf font file should be in the same directory for the game to work properly.
